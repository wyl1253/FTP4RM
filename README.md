# Fast Trajectory Planner with a Reinforcement Learning-Based Controller for Robotic Manipulators

This codebase provides instructions for integrating Fast-Planner with manipulator platforms and includes the improved PPO implementation from our paper for a single-arm robot.

For any algorithm you plan to run, please copy the ur_e_description/ folder into that algorithm’s directory.

Note: The current release supports only IPPO and its associated ablation and comparison experiments. In a later release, we will provide a version with Fast-Planner included but with our platform-specific information removed.
